⚡ Electricity Usage Analysis – MySQL Data Warehouse Project

This project is a MySQL-based electricity usage analytics system built using a **star schema data warehouse design**. A central fact table stores measurable consumption and billing metrics, while dimension tables (household, time, appliance, and environmental data) provide structured context for efficient querying and analysis.

The project demonstrates practical SQL skills including joins, aggregations, stored procedures, triggers, and relational design to analyze consumption patterns, automate billing calculations, and derive useful usage insights.

This project was completed as part of my **SQL training at Besant Technologies, Anna Nagar, Chennai**, under the guidance of my trainer **Deva Sir**, and reflects hands-on learning in database design and real-world analytics.

🔹 Key Highlights

* Star schema (Fact & Dimension modeling)
* ER design with foreign keys
* Advanced SQL queries
* Stored procedures & triggers
* Data analysis & reporting concepts

This project showcases my understanding of database architecture, SQL programming, and analytical thinking for real-world applications.
